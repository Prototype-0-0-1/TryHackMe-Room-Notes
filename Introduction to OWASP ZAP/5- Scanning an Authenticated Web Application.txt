##Scanning an Authenticated Web Application
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Without your Zap application being authenticated, it can't scan pages that are only accessible when you've logged in. Lets set up the OWASP ZAP application to scan these pages, using your logged in session.

Lets go to the DVWA machine (http://MACHINE_IP), and login using the following credentials:
    Username: admin
    Password: password

For the purpose of this exercise, once you've logged in, navigate to the DVWA Security tab and set the Security level to Low and then hit submit.
We're going to pass our authentication token into ZAP so that we can use the tool to scan authenticated webpages.

Enter inspect element and take note of your PHPSESSION cookie. 
In ZAP open the HTTP Sessions tab with the new tab button, and set the authenticated session as active.

Now re-scan the application. You’ll see it’s able to pick up a lot more. This is because its able to see all of the sections of DVWA that was previously behind the login page. 

Prevously the number of sites and the number of sites now, is way different since ZAP now is a logged in user.
