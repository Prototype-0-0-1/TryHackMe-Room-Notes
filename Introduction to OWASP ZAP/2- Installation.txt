##Installation
-----------------------------------
OWASP ZAP has a handy installer for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux systems.

Download and install it from the official website: https://www.zaproxy.org/download/
(Will be using Windows version for this instance. The actual product is same across all the platforms. So, no need to worry about any OS issues.)
