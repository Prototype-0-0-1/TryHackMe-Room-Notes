##Introduction
-------------------------------------------------
OWASP Zap is a security testing framework much like Burp Suite. It acts as a very robust enumeration tool. It’s used to test web applications.

#OWASP vs Burp
Most people in the Info-sec community DO just use Burp Suite. But OWASP ZAP has a few benefits and features that the Burp Suite does not

#What are the benefits to OWASP ZAP?
It’s completely open source and free. There is no premium version, no features are locked behind a paywall, and there is no proprietary code.

There’s a couple of feature benefits too with using OWASP ZAP over Burp Suite:
- Automated Web Application Scan: This will automatically passively and actively scan a web application, build a sitemap, and discover vulnerabilities. This is a paid feature in Burp. 
- Web Spidering: You can passively build a website map with Spidering. This is a paid feature in Burp.
- Unthrottled Intruder: You can bruteforce login pages within OWASP as fast as your machine and the web-server can handle. This is a paid feature in Burp.
- No need to forward individual requests through Burp: When doing manual attacks, having to change windows to send a request through the browser, and then forward in burp, can be tedious. OWASP handles both and you can just browse the site and OWASP will intercept automatically. This is NOT a feature in Burp. 

The room  will teach you how to do the following in ZAP: 
- Automated Scan
- Directory Bruteforce
- Authenticated Scan
- Login Page Bruteforce
- Install ZAP Extensions
