##Manual Scan
---------------------------------------------------------
Lets perform a manual scan against the DVWA machine.
Like Burp, you should set-up your proxy between OWASP ZAP and your Browser. We’ll be using Firefox. 
In the (Ctrl + Alt + O) options section, search for Local Proxies. Choose the port number which may not be used on your machine. The address will be: 127.0.0.1 since it is on your own localhost machine

Add ZAP Certificates:
    Without importing ZAP Certificates, ZAP is unable to handle simultaneous Web request forwarding and intercepting. Do not skip this step. 
    Save the certificate by going to Dymanimc SSL Certificates in the Options (Ctrl + Alt + O) tab of OWASP ZAP.

    In the same options menu, navigate to Dynamic SSL Certificates and save the certificate somewhere you’ll remember and not delete.

    Then, open Firefox, navigate to your preferences, and search for certificates and click “View Certificates” 
    Then click “Import” and then navigate to the earlier downloaded certificate and open it. 
    Select both and then hit OK.

Firefox Proxy Setup:
    Go back to your Firefox preferences and search for “proxy”. Click Settings.
    Adjust your Manual Proxy Configuration to match the details chosen for OWASP ZAP in the previous steps. (The port number as well as the address)

Now you’re set-up! Time to get into the fun stuff :)

- What IP do we use for the proxy?            
-- 127.0.0.1
--> Since, we are performing everything on the localhost machine itself.
