##The Morris Internet Worm
----------------------------------------
You may have noticed that the creators of the viruses I have shown you previously are not exactly prosecuted or punished. The main reason for this is that the laws were different. For example, when the Creeper virus was made laws were not really as "uptight" about data protection and computer misuse back then as it is now. Malware is a really tough subject and sometimes when you are doing something you think is right or fine, you can accidentally cause unintended harm. As well as the computer scientist I am going to talk about, this has happened in modern-day malware.

Skipping a few years of malicious programs, we come across The Morris Internet Worm. Released in 1988, Robert Tappan Morris created a worm that was supposed to highlight security flaws of the academic networks that it travelled to. This worked... but not how he expected. The only downfall of the worm was that it failed to check which computers it had already been to, thus infecting many computers multiple times and causing a denial of service attack, commonly known as a fork bomb.

Morris was the first person to be arrested from a felony conviction in the US under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse act.

The worm spread simply by exploiting known vulnerabilities in Unix Sendmail, rsh (remote shell)/rexec ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_r-commands ) and weak passwords. Although this caused many issues, it did make global awareness of the dangers of weak passwords. The worm infected 2000 computers within 15 hours and it often took 2 days to get off a single computer, rendering most useless. Reportedly 6000  computers were infected in the end and this was around 10% of the internet at the time.

Berkeley r-commands were a very big way that allowed Morris to access the computers, that and weak passwords. Similarly to "ssh", the worm was able to log in and execute commands on the system, just as you do on Try Hack Me! Although this is a little different as the way he did it was illegal. Many commands that Berkeley r-commands suite uses look very similar also, this is because it was originally designed for UNIX. (It was based on an early implementation of TCP/IP)
