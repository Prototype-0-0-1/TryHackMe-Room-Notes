##The Creeper Program
------------------------------------------------
Concepts of Malicious Software have been around since 1949, and one of the first known theories was created by John von Neumann. Von Neumann ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture ), who also devised the von Neumann architecture (which is very simply how computers transfer data to its hardware), produced work detailing self-replicating computer programs. This design is arguably the world's first computer virus but in reality, it is the first concept/design. This concept was proven 22 years later.

#Creeper
The Creeper Program, also known as the "Creeper worm" or "virus", was the first-ever virus to be created. Written by Bob Thomas in 1971, the program used ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) to transfer itself between computers (keep reading to learn about ARPANET). Creeper was created in the programming language PDP-10 Assembly( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-10 ), which ran on the operating system TENEX( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TENEX_(operating_system) ).

Bob Thomas came up with the idea from the unreliability of computers;
''''''''
"computers fail from time to time and work is lost. So I got interested in the possibility of moving an executing program from one computer to another without interrupting the ongoing operation of the program, at least to the extent that to an external observer nothing had happened."
''''''''

And this led to the creation of the program. You might be thinking, what did creeper actually do? Well, I'll tell you! Creeper would iteratively display the following message onto connected teletype computer screens: "I'm the creeper, catch me if you can!"

That is all the program would do, which is why it is not technically malware (it did not cause any harm to the computers or networks it visited) but I had to include it. Robert (the creator) purposely coded it so that it would remove older copies of itself before transferring to the next computer. This was proven useful as some of the software we will talk about in this room does not do that and it can cause accidental harm by copying to the same computer multiple times.

Ray Tomlinson later re-designed the Creeper Virus to copy to each computer, rather than deleting the older copy of itself. Some people claimed that this caused damage because, as said above, the program would accidentally copy to the same computer multiple times (but this was never proven), but what I did find was an interview with Ray Tomlinson. He stated that only 23 computers were infected and all operators of the computers gave permission and even "we only ran it a few times mostly on our own machines for debugging... so it never became a nuisance", you can read the whole interview here( https://www.osnews.com/story/29157/interview-with-ray-tomlinson-on-creeperreaper/ ).

Creeper was surprisingly named after a green ghoul on Scooby-doo!

#ARPANET
ARPANET originally started out with two specific protocols; Remote login and transferring files. After their project was denied, the team working on this project (known as the Network Working Group) decided to design a program formally called the Network Control Program, without all the unnecessary details, this was the start of computers being able to communicate within networks.

Packet Switching is breaking data into packets to then route or send said data to the receiver. The receiver (computer that is receiving the data) will then reassemble the packets back into whatever data/file was being sent. (this is still used today!)

This was the main way that data was transferred using ARPANET.
