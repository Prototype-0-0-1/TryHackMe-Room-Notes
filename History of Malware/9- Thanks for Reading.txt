You made it!
Thank you for joining the room and I hope you enjoyed it.
Most information that I used can be found in this room, and if any information seems a little wrong, please contact me.

There is a lot of malware that was not covered in this room so do not be afraid to research. I made sure to leave out really big ones like "wannacry" or "ILoveYou" as they're well known, but if you do not know go find out! They are definitely worth it.

Thank you :D

- Thanks!
