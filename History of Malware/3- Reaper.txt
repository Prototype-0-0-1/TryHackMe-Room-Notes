##Reaper
-------------------------------------
Reaper was created not too long after Creeper was released.
The creator was Ray Tomlinson which you may recognise as the same person to re-design creeper.

Reaper's purpose was to remove any copies of creeper that it could find, but it moved differently to Creeper (I'm not 100% sure the full details on this but you can read about it from my reference). Bob Thomas' main project was "to develop a resource-sharing capability", known as RSEXEC "so that users could develop applications that could move to and run on another computer".

Whilst installing RSEXEC they also installed Creeper and Creeper was then used to demonstrate the capability of resource-sharing (This also worked through ARPANET and lots of other stuff, the information provided is vague so if you want to research these viruses then you have to piece it together). Using an RSEXEC API (https://blogs.mulesoft.com/biz/tech-ramblings-biz/what-are-apis-how-do-apis-work/) , the application could "package itself and its data up and ship itself to another RSEXEC instance on another computer which would unpack and fire up the application", but in simpler words, Reaper would move its way similarly to Creeper and then get to work; removing Creeper.

A risk with any software is the possibility of bugs and Ray said that it was a simple program designed to keep track of which computers it moved to. As a result, it would be "pretty trivial to visit them all unless the network became disconnected." 

According to malware.wiki Reaper is called a nematode, which is a type of malware which removes other malware but Reaper was actually the first anti-virus software produced, the term "nematode" is not commonly used nor could I find any documentation for the term.
