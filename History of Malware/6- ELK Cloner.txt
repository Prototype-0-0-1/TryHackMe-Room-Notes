##ELK Cloner
-------------------------------
Richard Skrenta, a 15-year-old high school student known for his pranks and practical jokes, created one of the first microcomputer viruses that spread outside of a computer system or laboratory (also known as "in the wild").

The malware worked by attaching itself to the Apple II operating systems and spread via floppy disk. It was written in 1982 originally as a practical joke to mess with his friends.

The technique that Elk Cloner used is a technique now called "boot sector virus". The program was placed into a game's code until an unsuspecting victim started the game for the 50th time. This then activated the virus. Instead of launching the game, it would change to a blank screen that displayed a poem about the virus:

'''''''
Elk Cloner: The program with a personality
it will get on all your disks
it will infiltrate your chips
Yes, it's Cloner!
It will stick to you like glue
It will modify RAM too
Send in the Cloner!
'''''''

If the computer booted from an infected floppy disk, a copy of the virus was placed in the computer's memory, this then spread to uninfected discs that were inserted into infected computers. Elk Cloner also wrote a signature byte to the disk's directory, indicating that it had already been infected.

Elk Cloner caused accidental harm as the Apple DOS disks had their reserved tracks overwritten, thus making it malware.

Boot Sector Viruses are less common in modern technology, but still are relevant and important to know about. They usually infect the boot sector (the part which starts the computer) and once infected, they will try to infect every disc inserted into the infected computer but can be removed. The computer does not have to successfully boot in order for the computer to become infected. (you will only see this with floppy discs)

This idea was created when people would no longer give him their floppy discs in order for him to put private or other software on them, he then thought how could he alter people's discs "without them letting him touch them", and then the idea was born! Well, not as easy as that. Keep in mind that Richard was extremely talented and loved computers and is a professional, Elk Cloner took him 2 weeks to write in assembly language. Later he found out from a friend in the US Navy that they were among those whose computers caught the virus.
