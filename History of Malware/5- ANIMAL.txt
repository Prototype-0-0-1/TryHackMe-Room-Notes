##ANIMAL
------------------------
In 1975 the first Trojan was written. ANIMAL, created by John Walker, would act as a game and ask the user a number of questions to guess the type of animal they were thinking of.

Whilst the user played the "fun" game, another program, or subroutine, called "PERVADE" would create a copy of itself and ANIMAL in every directory that the user has access to. 

A Trojan relates to a wooden horse that the Greeks built during the Trojan War. The story goes that men hid inside the horse which was then given to the city of Troy as a gift. All of the men inside broke out and infiltrated the city from inside winning the war. Similarly to the way that a Trojan pretends to be a friendly program but secretly has a malicious purpose.

ANIMAL was not malicious however, the program was carefully written to ensure that no directory structure or files were damaged. It spread across UNIVACs (Universal Automatic Computer ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIVAC )) when users with overlapping permissions discovered the game. Eventually, the program was halted by an unintended Operating System upgrade, which changed the format of the file status tables that PERVADE used for safe copying (file status tables allowed the program to avoid copying to the wrong area, causing damage) this meant that ANIMAL could not find any place safe to copy and stopped itself.

Originally, ANIMAL was coded in 1974 as a non-malicious 20 question game but later the sub-routine (a simple set of instructions embedded within a program) PERVADE was added in 1975. John thought this was a good idea. ANIMAL would eventually be run by a privileged user and "it would copy itself into the system library, thus making it available to all users", John goes onto say that users exchanged tapes with other installations and as those tapes most likely had ANIMAL on it, John found the program spreading to other systems.
