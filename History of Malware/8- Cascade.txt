##Cascade
--------------------------
To keep on the topic of first types of malware, Cascade was notably the first type of malware to use a form of encryption. This encryption was not used to directly harm the user's data, but rather to keep the program undetected. As well as encryption, the virus was hard to detect because of its physical properties; the software was not obvious but some mutations to the code caused bugs and made it a little easier to see. 

In the 80s, specifically on the Digital Equipment (a large computer company) operating systems, a common file extension for executables was ".COM". Similarly to how a BATCH file or a .sh (shell script, used on Linux operating systems) file would work, this extension allowed text files containing commands to be executable.

Something to note is the virus would try not to infect IBM Computers ( https://www.ibm.com/uk-en ) by looking for text containing a copyright statement. This failed however and a bug allowed it to infect all computers. Later on, a headquarter in Belgium owned by IBM was accidentally infected and this lead to them releasing their private anti-virus software. Another thing to note is that the virus would only work by executing the infected file. Each time the infected file was run, it would slowly make changes to the computer.

#How would you know if your computer was infected?

There were a few ways to tell if your computer had been infected with the Cascade virus but this differed with the variants of Cascade that were released. In different areas, different forms of the virus were found, some were believed to have "mutated" code, some did not use the encryption and one infected two companies but did not use its trademark sign making it harder to detect (keep reading for more information). All the base source code for these different variants were the same, including the last one that was found. The creator of the virus was presumed to have used another assembler but with the same code, hence the change.

The first obvious tell was checking your file sizes. Infected files would have a much larger file size (specifically by 1704 bytes in most variants) and simply checking this would allow you to properly remove it from your system. In one of these variants, a single byte had seemed to mutate causing a bug in the code, making Cascade infect one file multiple times.

The second way of telling was checking the HOST file. Cascade changed the first 3 bytes of the host file and added it to the first three bytes of the virus' main file. (I am unsure why it did this exactly as different sources either do not cover it or do not give a full explanation but if you are interested, go ahead and research!) Then, between October 1st and December 31st, the payload would activate. This DOS ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS ) Malware would make the text fall from the screen one by one until a heap of characters were at the bottom (some say this was an accident) if another payload was running, like that of techno ( https://malware.wikia.org/wiki/Techno ), Cascade would wait until techno had finished until it made the text fall from the screen. On top of that, the computer would emit noises which was popular in many different viruses at this time.

Cascade was truly a big virus, some accounts claiming there were forty different variants. If you find it interesting then you should definitely research it but this room is mainly an overview of the viruses and how they work.
