##Wabbit
-----------------------------
The Wabbit (Rabbit) virus was written in 1974. The name, which derived from Elmer Fudd's way of saying "Rabbit" in the looney tunes cartoons, was one of the first self-replicating malware. The name also connotes to the fast pace in which the software would replicate itself, like that of a rabbit reproducing. Wabbit would work so fast that the system would figuratively choke on its resources and end up crashing. 

Rabbit was one of the best versions of malware, not only for its ingenious idea but for its use in education. It was considered the first malicious program (some may argue Creeper was but due to Creeper's non-harming personality it is not) and grew from concepts of malware created from other computer scientists. The malware was only able to infect the machine it was put on and did not pass via a network, hence why it is not classed as a worm.

Now, we would see Rabbit as being a form of denial-of-service known as a "fork bomb". (Keep reading for further details.) Variants of Rabbit worked on the system framework IBM OS and worked similar to the original concept.

Rabbit works by creating an infinite loop that continually creates system processes and copies of the original file, creating a high number of CPU cycles (the time for the execution of one process) which "constipates" the system and consumes operating system resources, causing it to get slower until its eventual crash. (Also known as a fork bomb ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb ) ) In modern days, a denial of service attack is an attack which makes a machine, network or server inaccessible to its users.
