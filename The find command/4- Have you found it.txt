##Have you found it?
--------------------------------------
To conclude this tutorial, there are two more things that you should know of. The first is that you can use the redirection operator > with the find command. You can save the results of the search to a file, and more importantly, you can suppress the output of any possible errors to make the output more readable. This is done by appending 2> /dev/null to your command. This way, you won’t see any results you’re not allowed to access.


The second thing is the -exec flag. You can use it in your find command to execute a new command, following the -exec flag, like so: -exec whoami \;. The possibilities enabled by this option are beyond the scope of this tutorial, but most notably it can be used for privilege escalation.

- You are now better equipped to find anything you’re looking for in a filesystem.
