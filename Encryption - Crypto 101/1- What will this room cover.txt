This room will cover:
    Why cryptography matters for security and CTFs
    The two main classes of cryptography and their uses
    RSA, and some of the uses of RSA
    2 methods of Key Exchange
    Notes about the future of encryption with the rise of Quantum Computing

Note: This room expects some familiarity with tools, and some research into how to use them yourself!
I recommend completing CC Pentesting(https://tryhackme.com/room/ccpentesting) first for some familiarity with John The Ripper.
