Shodan.io is a search engine for the Internet of Things.
Shodan scans the whole internet and indexes the services run on each IP address.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Finding services
We can ping tryhackme.com and the ping response will tell us their IP address.
Then once we do this, we put the IP address into Shodan to get the details
We can see that TryHackMe runs on Cloudflare in the United States and they have many ports open.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Autonomous System Numbers
An autonomous system number (ASN) is a global identifier of a range of IP addresses. If you are an enormous company like Google you will likely have your own ASN for all of the IP addresses you own.

We can put the IP address into an ASN lookup tool such as https://www.ultratools.com/tools/asnInfo (This might have been re-located)
Which tells us they have the ASN AS14061.

https://securitytrails.com/blog/asn-lookup : Top 6 ASN Lookup Tools to fetch Autonomous System Information

On Shodan.io,we can search using the ASN filter. The filter is ASN:[number] where number is the number we got from earlier, which is AS14061.

Knowing the ASN is helpful, because we can search Shodan for things such as coffee makers or vulnerable computers within our ASN, which we know (if we are a large company) is on our network.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Banners
To get the most out of Shodan, it’s important to understand the search query syntax.
Devices run services, and Shodan stores information about them. The information is stored in a banner. It’s the most fundamental part of Shodan.

An example banner looks like:

{
		"data": "Moxa Nport Device",
		"Status": "Authentication disabled",
		"Name": "NP5232I_4728",
		"MAC": "00:90:e8:47:10:2d",
		"ip_str": "46.252.132.235",
		"port": 4800,
		"org": "Starhub Mobile",
		"location": {
				"country_code": "SG"
		}
 }

We’re looking at the output of a single port, which includes information about the IP and authentication details.
You don’t really see this outside of the API, so we won’t delve into it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##Filters

On the Shodan.io homepage, we can click on “explore” to view the most up voted search queries. The most popular one is webcams.
https://www.shodan.io/explore

Note: this is a grey area. It is legal to view a publicly accessible webcam, it is illegal to try to break into a password protected one. Use your brain and research the laws of your country!

One of the other most up voted searches is a search for MYSQL databases.
https://www.shodan.io/search?query=product%3AMySQL

If we look at the search, we can see it is another filter.
product:MySQL

Knowing this, we can actually combine 2 searches into 1.
On TryHackMe’s ASN, let’s try to find some MYSQL servers.

We use this search query
asn:AS14061 product:MySQL
And ta-da! We have MYSQL servers on the TryHackMe ASN (which is really the DigitalOcean ASN).
https://www.shodan.io/search?query=asn%3AAS14061+product%3AMySQL

Shodan has many powerful filters. My favourite one is the vuln filter, which let’s us search for IP addresses vulnerable to an exploit.
Let’s say we want to find IP addresses vulnerable to Eternal Blue:
vuln:ms17-010
However, this is only available for academic or business users, to prevent bad actors from abusing this!
City Country Geo (coordinates) Hostname net (based on IP / CIDR) os (find operating systems) port before/after (timeframes)

#API
Shodan.io has an API! It requires an account, so I won’t talk about it here.

If you want to explore the Shodan API, I’ve written a blog post about finding Pi-Holes with it here:
https://github.com/beesecurity/How-I-Hacked-Your-Pi-Hole/blob/master/README.md

The API lets us programmatically search Shodan and receive a list of IP addresses in return. If we are a company, we can write a script to check over our IP addresses to see if any of them are vulnerable.

PS: You can automatically filter on Shodan by clicking the things in the left hand side bar!

#Google & Filtering

Learning to filter with Google. Helpful hint: pay close attention to what the question is asking you!
List of shodan filters: https://beta.shodan.io/search/filters
Answers can be found on the left hand side of your search results. (The total results)

- What is the top operating system for MYSQL servers in Google's ASN?
--> The search used ''' product:MySQL asn:AS15169 '''. As of making these notes, 5.7.32-35-log is the most recent one.

- What is the 2nd most popular country for MYSQL servers in Google's ASN?
--> The search used ''' product:MySQL asn:AS15169 '''. Look at the left side

- Under Google's ASN, which is more popular for nginx, Hypertext Transfer Protocol or Hypertext Transfer Protocol with SSL?
-->
''' product:nginx asn:AS15169 ''' -> Results = 489,677
''' HTTP asn:AS15169 ''' (Since having HTTP also includes the 'with SSL', since HTTP with SSL contains the word 'HTTP']) -> Results = 2,825,346
The number of results will differ based upon when the query is being searched
-->

- Under Google's ASN, what is the most popular city?
--> ''' asn:AS15169 ''' and searched at: https://www.shodan.io/search/facet and selected the dropdown as city (as of making these notes Kansas City is the most popular city)

- Under Google's ASN in Los Angeles, what is the top operating system according to Shodan?
--> From the results of the above search, selected Los Angles making the query to become: ''' asn:AS15169 city:"Los Angeles" ''', here we see the left side under the heading: TOP OPERATING SYSTEMS (Currently, it says Debian as of making these notes)

- Using the top Webcam search from the explore page, does Google's ASN have any webcams? Yay / nay.
--> Search for ''' asn:<asn-number> webcam '''

#Shodan Monitor
Shodan Monitor is an application for monitoring your devices in your own network. In their words:
Keep track of the devices that you have exposed to the Internet. Setup notifications, launch scans and gain complete visibility into what you have connected.

Previously we had to do this using their API, but now we have this fancy application.
Access the dashboard via this link:
https://monitor.shodan.io/dashboard
You’ll see it’s asking for an IP range.

Once we add a network, we can see it in our dashboard.
If we click on the settings cog, we can see that we have a range of “scans” Shodan performs against our network.

Anytime Shodan detects a security vulnrability in one of these categories, it will email us.
If we go to the dashboard again we can see it lays some things out for us.

Most notably:
	Top Open Ports (most common)
	Top Vulnerabilities (stuff we need to deal with right away)
	Notable Ports (unusual ports that are open)
	Potential Vulenrabilites
	Notable IPs (things we should investigate in more depth).

The interesting part is that you can actually monitor other peoples networks using this. For bug bounties you can save a list of IPs and Shodan will email you if it finds any problems.

Note: This is a premium product, but you can often get $1 Shodan accounts on their Black Friday deals.

- What URL takes you to Shodan Monitor?
--> As stated above :)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Shodan Dorking
Shodan has some lovely webpages with Dorks that allow us to find things. Their search example webpages feature some.

Some fun ones include:
has_screenshot:true encrypted attention

Which uses optical character recognition and remote desktop to find machines compromised by ransomware on the internet.

vuln:CVE-2014-0160 Internet connected machines vulenrable to heartbleed. Note: CVE search is only allowed to academic or business subscribers.

Solar Winds Supply Chain Attack by using Favicons:
http.favicon.hash:-1776962843

You can find more Shodan Dorks on GitHub: https://github.com/humblelad/Shodan-Dorks , https://0ut3r.space/2020/07/25/shodan-dorks/

- What dork lets us find PCs infected by Ransomware?
--> The intended ansswer might not be correct one totally. But the answer is same as the first dork in this section
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Shodan Browser Extension

Shodan also has an extension.
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shodan/jjalcfnidlmpjhdfepjhjbhnhkbgleap

When installed, you can click on it and it’ll tell you the IP address of the webserver running, what ports are open, where it’s based and if it has any security issues.
I imagine this is a good extension for any people interested in bug bounties, being quickly able to tell if a system looks vulnerable or not based on the Shodan output.

The room is a really good resource. Shodan is a really great tool. Although, the room data and tasks could use some updating, it is a great learning resource nonetheless.
