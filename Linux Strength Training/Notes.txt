As a security researcher you will often be required to find specific files/folders on a system based on various conditions ranging from, but not limited to the following:
    filename
    size
    user/group
    date modified
    date accessed

There are many more useful commands aside from the examples above. If you ever have trouble understanding any of the syntax or getting it to work, head on over to explainshell.com to check the syntax and see how this tool can help you on your journey to Linux greatness.

Find files modified after a specific date: find [directory path] -type f -newermt '[date and time]'
Find files based on date modified: find [directory path] -type f -newermt [start date range] ! -newermt [end date range]	
Find files based on date accessed: find [directory path] -type f -newerat [start date range] ! -newerat [end date range]	

find / -type f -newerat 2017-09-12 ! -newerat 2017-09-14
(all dates before 2017-09-12 will be excluded; all dates after 2017-09-14 will be excluded, therefore this only leaves 2017-09-13 as the date to look for.)

Find files with a specific keyword: grep -iRl [directory path/keyword]

- How would you rename a folder named -logs to -newlogs
--> mv -- -logs -newlogs

Move all files from current directory into another directory: mv * [directory to move files to]

- Hypothetically, you want to transfer a file from your /home/james/Desktop/ with the name script.py to the remote machine (192.168.10.5) directory of /home/john/scripts using the username of john. What would be the full command to do this?
--> scp /home/james/Desktop/script.py john@192.168.10.5:/home/john/scripts
