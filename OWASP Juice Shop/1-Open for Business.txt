##Getting Started
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Within this room, we will look at OWASP's TOP 10 vulnerabilities (https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) in web applications. You will find these in all types in all types of web applications. But for today we will be looking at OWASP's own creation, Juice Shop!

We will be using Burp Suite, so if you haven't already got it set up, here is a link to the 'Burp Suite' (https://tryhackme.com/room/rpburpsuite) room.
[The 'Burp Suite' room is a subscriber-only room, meaning you will require a TryHackMe subscription in order to access it]

In addition, it's highly recommended to check out the 'Web Fundamentals' (https://tryhackme.com/room/webfundamentals) room. 
[The 'Web Fundamentals' room is a free room, meaning that, like this room, anyone is able to complete it]

Juice Shop is a large application so we will not be covering every topic from the top 10.
We will, however, cover the following topics which we recommend you take a look at as you progress through this room.

I'll be using OWASP ZAP for the whole room, so yay :)
Note: OWASP ZAP's passive scans might trigger a few flags by themselves. So, if you are looking for those flags, Task 8 will guide you, where to see these flags.

<------------------------------------------------->

Injection (https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection)

Broken Authentication (https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection)

Sensitive Data Exposure (https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A3-Sensitive_Data_Exposure)

Broken Access Control (https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A5-Broken_Access_Control)

Cross-Site Scripting XSS (https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A7-Cross-Site_Scripting_(XSS))

<------------------------------------------------->

[Task 3] and onwards will require a flag, which will be displayed on completion of the task.

#Troubleshooting
Temporarily disable burp in your proxy settings for the current browser. Refresh the page and the flag will be shown. 
This is not an issue with the application but an issue with burp stopping the flag from being shown. 
If you are doing the XSS Tasks and they are not working. Clear your cookies and site data, as this can sometimes be an issue. 
If you are sure that you have completed the task but it's still not working. Go to [Task 8], as this will allow you to check its completion.
