All in all, if you are familiar with Python and considering creating a website, Django can be a really good choice. As for penetration tester, it is important to understand the basic structure of Django-powered websites in order to be able to identify possible weaknesses and mistakes a developer can make.

For moving forward, it would be ideal to know some basics about Python. It would be beneficial to understand the concepts.
