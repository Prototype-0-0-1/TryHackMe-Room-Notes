    ATT&CK® (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) Framework
    CAR (Cyber Analytics Repository) Knowledge Base
    SHIELD (sorry, not a fancy acronym) Active Defense
    AEP (ATT&CK Emulation Plans)

APT is an acronym for Advanced Persistent Threat. This can be considered a team/group (threat group), or even country (nation-state group), that engages in long-term attacks against organizations and/or countries. The term 'advanced' can be misleading as it will tend to cause us to believe that each APT group all have some super-weapon, e.i. a zero-day exploit, that they use. That is not the case. As we will see a bit later, the techniques these APT groups use are quite common and can be detected with the right implementations in place. 
You can view FireEye's current list of APT groups here.: https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/apt-groups.html

TTP is an acronym for Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures, but what does each of these terms mean?
    The Tactic is the adversary's goal or objective.
    The Technique is how the adversary achieves the goal or objective.
    The Procedure is how the technique is executed.
(Another way to understand, Tactic is the goal, Technique is the blueprint/plan, Procedure is the implementation)

MITRE ATT&CK® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations
Direct your attention to the bottom of the page to view the ATT&CK® Matrix for Enterprise. Across the top of the matrix, there are 14 categories. Each category contains the techniques an adversary could use to perform the tactic. The categories cover the seven-stage Cyber Attack Lifecycle (credit Lockheed Martin for the Cyber Kill Chain).

Example:
    Under Initial Access, there are 9 techniques. Some of the techniques have sub-techniques, such as Phishing. 
    If we click on the gray bar to the right, a new layer appears listing the sub-techniques. 
    To get a better understanding of this technique and it's associated sub-techniques, click on Phishing.
    We have been directed to a page dedicated to the technique known as Phishing and all related information regarding the technique, such as a brief description, Procedure Examples, and Mitigations.

    You can alternatively resort to using the Search feature to retrieve all associated information regarding a given technique, sub-technique, and/or group. 

Lastly, the same data can be viewed via the MITRE ATT&CK® Navigator: "The ATT&CK® Navigator is designed to provide basic navigation and annotation of ATT&CK® matrices, something that people are already doing today in tools like Excel. We've designed it to be simple and generic - you can use the Navigator to visualize your defensive coverage, your red/blue team planning, the frequency of detected techniques, or anything else you want to do."

At the top left, there are 3 sets of controls: selection controls, layer controls, and technique controls. I encourage you to inspect each of the options under each control to get familiar with them. The question mark at the far right will provide additional information regarding the navigator. 
To summarize, we can use the ATT&CK Matrix to map a threat group to their tactics and techniques.  There are various methods the search can be initiated. The questions below will help you become more familiar with the ATT&CK®. It is recommended to start answering the questions from the Phishing page. https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/

-- T1566

- Based on this technique, what mitigation covers identifying social engineering techniques?
-- User Training

- There are other possible areas for detection for this technique, which occurs after what other technique?
-- User Execution

- What group has used spear phishing in their campaigns?
-- Dragonfly

- Based on the information for this group, what are their associated groups?

--> i.e. Lateral Tool Transfer
-- PsExec

- Based on the information about this tool, what group used a customized version of it?
-- FIN5

- This group has been active since what year?
-- 2008

- Instead of Mimikatz, what OS Credential Dumping tool is does this group use?
-- Windows Credential Editor

Cyber Analytics Repository: CAR
https://car.mitre.org/

The MITRE Cyber Analytics Repository (CAR) is a knowledge base of analytics developed by MITRE based on the MITRE ATT&CK® adversary model. CAR defines a data model that is leveraged in its pseudocode representations but also includes implementations directly targeted at specific tools (e.g., Splunk, EQL) in its analytics. With respect to coverage, CAR is focused on providing a set of validated and well-explained analytics, in particular with regards to their operating theory and rationale.

Example:
    Let's begin our journey by reviewing CAR-2020-09-001: Scheduled Task - File Access. https://car.mitre.org/analytics/CAR-2020-09-001/
    Upon visiting the page, we're given a brief description of the analytic and references to ATT&CK (technique, sub-technique, and tactic).
    We're also provided with Pseudocode and a query on how to search for this specific analytic within Splunk. A pseudocode is a plain, human-readable way to describe a set of instructions or algorithms that a program or system will perform.
    Note the reference to Sysmon. We have not covered Sysmon as of yet, but you can read more about this tool here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon

To take full advantage of CAR, we can view the Full Analytic List or the CAR ATT&CK® Navigator layer to view all the analytics.
https://car.mitre.org/analytics https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/beta/enterprise/#layerURL=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmitre-attack%2Fcar%2Fmaster%2Fdocs%2Fcar_attack%2Fcar_attack.json

Full Analytic List
    In the Full Analytic List view, we can see what implementations are available for any given analytic at a single glance, along with what OS platform it applies to.

CAR ATTACK Navigator
    (The techniques highlighted in blue are the analytics currently in CAR)

Let's look at another analytic to see a different implementation, CAR-2014-11-004: Remote PowerShell Sessions. https://car.mitre.org/analytics/CAR-2014-11-004/

Under Implementations, pseudocode is provided and an EQL version of the pseudocode. EQL (pronounced as 'equal'), and it's an acronym for Event Query Language. EQL can be utilized to query, parse, and organize Sysmon event data. You can read more about this here. https://eql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

To summarize, CAR is a great place for finding analytics that takes us further than the Mitigation and Detection summaries in the ATT&CK® framework. This tool is not a replacement for ATT&CK® but an added resource.

- For the above analytic, what is the pseudocode a representation of?
-- Splunk Search

- What tactic has an ID of TA0003?
--> Look in the tactics one by one
-- Persistence

- What is the name of the library that is a collection of Zeek (BRO) scripts?
--> https://car.mitre.org/
-- BZAR

- What is the name of the technique for running executables with the same hash and different names?
--> https://car.mitre.org/analytics/
-- Masquerading

- Examine CAR-2013-05-004, what additional information is provided to analysts to ensure coverage for this technique?
--> https://car.mitre.org/analytics/CAR-2013-05-004/
-- Unit Tests
