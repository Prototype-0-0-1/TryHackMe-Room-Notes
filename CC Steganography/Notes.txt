Steganography(Stego) is the art of concealing something inside something else, for example: A message inside a jpg file, or a binary inside a png

Steghide is one of the most famous steganography tools, and for good reason. It's a classic method, hiding a message inside an image, and steghide does it effectively and efficiently.

zsteg is to png's what steghide is to jpg's. It supports various techniques to extract any and all data from png files.
Note: zsteg also supports BMP files, but it is primarily used for png's.

Exiftool is a tool that allows you to view and edit image metadata. While this in itself is not a stego tool, I would be remiss not to include at least a footnote on it as one of the most popular forms of image stego is to hide messages in the metadata.

Personally this is one of my favorite image stego tools. It supports just about every image file, and is able to extract all types of data from it. It is an incredibly useful tool if you don't know exactly what you're looking for, as it has a myriad of built in tests to extract any and all data.
Note: Stegoveritas has other features as well such as color correcting images

Spectrogram stegonography is the art of hiding hidden an image inside in an audio file's spectogram. Therefore when ever dealing with audio stego it is always worth analyzing the spectrogram of the audio. To do this task we will be using Sonic Visualizer: https://www.sonicvisualiser.org/download.html

Note: This introduction will be done using the included wav1 file.
